# email-workshop

Welcome to the wonderful world of email. In this workshop we'll be discussing topics like:

* Email best practices 
* Development
* Responsive styling
* HTML/CSS guidlines
* Testing 
* Automation tooling

We'll also be doing some hands on training building an email from scratch!  

**Be sure to clone this repo prior to attending if you'd like to follow along with us. If you don't, WE'LL KICK YOU OUT! Just kidding, we'll politely shove you out! Just kidding, you'll just have fun watching us live code and probably screw everything up!!**
